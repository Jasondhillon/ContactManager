# What do:

### npm install 
- Installs all the dependencies needed to get started

### npm run dev
- Starts both the front/back -ends in the same terminal

## Side Note:
- All the changes currrently go to the mongoDB created from heroku, so all changes will be made to the server in production. Not a big deal, but you can change this through config/default.json and changing the uri for mongoDB with your own, so you can verify the DB changes
